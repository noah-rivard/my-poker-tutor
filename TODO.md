# TODO: Roadmap to Full Poker Simulator

This document outlines a potential path to evolve **my-poker-tutor** into a fully operational No Limit Hold'em simulator with AI opponents and comprehensive hand histories.

**Integrate AI Player Strategies**
   - Start with simple rule-based bots for basic decisions.
   - Add equity calculations using `pokerkit` to guide betting choices.
   - Explore more advanced approaches such as Monte Carlo Tree Search or reinforcement learning.
   - Fix `ai.py` helper functions which currently contain duplicate code and syntax errors.

**Persist Hand Histories**
   - Provide an export format (e.g., JSON or text) for later analysis.
   - Include options to load and review past sessions.

**Enhance the GUI**
   - Display stacks, bets, and pot amounts visually.

These steps provide a roadmap toward a more complete poker simulator with AI bots and analytics capabilities.
